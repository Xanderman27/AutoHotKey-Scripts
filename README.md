# AutoHotKey Scripts

All of these scripts are free to use and I enourage tinkering with my scripts. 

Do note that you may get banned using these scripts.


### Fishing Simulator (Roblox)

- Ctrl + Shift + p to toggle the script on/off

 - Works on 16:9 Monitors (Haven't tested it but doubt it works on other ratios)

 - Adjust Line 24 to adjust for different hook speeds
